"""Break one claim at a time and confirm a test objects.

A SURVIVED mutant is a change to the code that no test noticed — either a gap in
the suite, or a test that only appears to cover the behaviour. See CLAUDE.md,
"No test is accepted until it has been shown red".

Run from `rhythmic/`:

Nothing is committed by this script: each source file is restored in a `finally`
block, and the run ends by asserting `git status` is clean.
